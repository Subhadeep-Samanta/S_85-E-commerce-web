# Milestone 5 - Sign-Up Page & Form Validation

## Introduction 🌟
Welcome to Milestone 5! You’ve made fantastic progress so far, and in this milestone, we’re taking your application one step further. We’ll focus on building the **Sign-Up Page** on the frontend and setting up routes to handle user sign-ups smoothly. This milestone is all about creating a great user experience while ensuring secure and clean user input.

If some of these concepts feel new, don’t worry! We’ll break everything down so it’s easy to follow and implement step by step.

## Learning Goals 🎯
By the end of this milestone, you will:
- **Build the Frontend UI**: Create a Sign-Up page where users can enter their details.
- **Implement Form Validation**: Ensure that user inputs (like email and password) are validated before submission.
- **Update the README file**: Document your progress effectively.

## Key Concepts 📌

### 1. What’s a Sign-Up Page?
A **Sign-Up Page** is where users provide their details to create an account. This page typically includes fields like:
- **Name**
- **Email**
- **Password**

When a user submits this information, it gets sent to the server for processing and storage. Our goal is to create a **clean, user-friendly sign-up form** that improves user experience.

### 2. What is Form Validation?
**Form Validation** ensures that users enter data in the correct format before submitting it to the server. It helps prevent errors and protects against security vulnerabilities.

Some common validation rules include:
- Checking if the **email is in the correct format** (e.g., `example@domain.com`).
- Ensuring the **password meets security requirements** (e.g., minimum length of 6 characters).
- Making sure all **required fields are filled** before submission.

Adding form validation improves both **security and usability**, ensuring the backend receives clean and valid data.
