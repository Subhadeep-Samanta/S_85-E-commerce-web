# Milestone 3: Backend Setup & MongoDB Connection 🚀

## Overview  
In Milestone 3, we focused on setting up the backend structure, connecting the server to MongoDB, and implementing basic error handling to ensure a more robust backend for the e-commerce application.

## Key Accomplishments

### 📁 Backend Folder Structure  
- Organized the backend directory with folders for `models/`, `controllers/`, `routes/`, and `middleware/` to maintain a clean structure.

### 🖥 Server Setup  
- Configured and set up a Node.js + Express server to handle future API endpoints.
- Implemented a basic server setup to handle requests and responses.

### 🔗 MongoDB Integration  
- Configured the connection to MongoDB using the Mongoose library.
- Set up the connection string in the `.env` file for environment-based configuration.
  
### ⚠️ Error Handling  
- Added basic error-handling middleware to handle uncaught exceptions and unhandled promise rejections.

### 📊 Database Models (if applicable)  
- Started designing basic models for the application (such as user models, product models, etc.) to facilitate the interaction with the database.

### 🎯 Learning Outcomes  
By completing this milestone, we learned:
- How to structure the backend with models, routes, and controllers.
- Connecting a Node.js server to a MongoDB database using Mongoose.
- Implementing basic error-handling and logging for better debugging.

## ✅ Submission Details  
- Code is pushed to the GitHub repository created in Milestone 1.
- The repository includes:
  - Organized backend folder structure (`models/`, `controllers/`, `routes/`).
  - Configured MongoDB connection with Mongoose.
  - Basic error-handling code to catch exceptions and unhandled rejections.
  - Updated README summarizing the progress.

🚀 Ready for the next milestone!
